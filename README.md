Backbonejs
==========

Backbone JS experiment - Experimentation with Backbone.js

Things to remember:

1. Initialize Method: Called when a new instance of a model is created. (Pg:29)
2. Default Property: Set default values in your Model using Defaults property.
3. Model.get(): Provides an easy access to a Model's attributes. Get singles values such as
	console.log(todo2.get('title'));
4. toJSON() Method: Read or clone all of a modelâ€™s data attributes, use its toJSON() method. Returns a copy of the attributes as an object. Not an JSON string.
5. JSON.stringfy() : Returns the value as a string instead of an object.
6. Model.set(): Sets a hash containing one or more attibutes on the model. When attributes change the state of the model through Model.Set(), it triggers change events. Ex: change:name, change:age.
7. Model exposes an .attributes attribute - internal hash containing the state of an model. JSON object. Used to set values. Bypasses the triggers bound to the model.
8. slient:true - will silence events/ no events might be triggered. 
9. Add listeners: Add listeners to watch for the changes in the model in the initialize() method.
10. Model.validate(): Validation for Model. Allows for checking values prior to setting them. Model is validated when you use Model.set() or when you use Model.save()
11. Views in Backbone does not have the markup. Logic behind presentation of the model's user data to the user.
12. Views render method can be bound to Model's change event, so the changes are instant.
13. 'el' is a reference to a DOM element. 'el' composes all the markup required to be inserted into the DOM that avoids multiple reflows and repaints. This helps with improving the performance of the browser.
14. There are two ways to assocaite an DOM element.One is to create an element for the view itself or associate an element that is already present on the page.
15. New element in the View can use a combination of: tagname,id,and classsName.Nothing specified tagName is 'div'.
16. view.$el - $(view.el) 
	view.$(selector) - $(view.el).find(selector)

17. setElement - can be used to bind an View to different DOM element.
18. render() - Defines the logic for rendering an template.
19. _.template() - method complies Javascript templates into functions that can evaluated for rendering.
20. return this; - only to create the list once and avoiding repaints. Making views easily readable in other parents views.
21. event Hash - Allows you to attach events to the 'el' or el-relative selectors. Current view object within the call back function.  
	'eventName selector': 'callbackFunction'
